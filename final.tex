\section{Welcome to LPG gas agency:}
\section{Aim}
The Aim of this mini project programme is to provide a successfull gas Cylinder delivary to the registered customer,by using some criteria which works as functions in this programmme. This project contains total ten functions.
\section{Following are the functions used in this project}
\subsection{Customername}
This function take the input character name by Customer by using gets and puts library function.
\subsection{registerednum}
This function take the input of customer's registered number on LPG gas agency as the Cylinder can be booked by registered number only.
\subsection{modeofpayment}
This function is to select the mode of payment by customer's this is offline or online. customer's have to press 1 for online payment and 2 for offline payment.
\subsection{employeeinfo}
This function takes input of employee name and employee mobile number and display the respective information.
\subsection{addressofcustomer}
This function takes input of address of customer for delivary of cylinder.which contain current location and street number of customer's house.
\subsection{cylinderlimit}
This function basically check wheather you can take cylinder or not ,the limit is of having 15 cylinder in  a year and you exceeds the limit you can't take cylinder . here we have used if else condition in this function.
\subsection{verifyDAC}
Delivary authentication code is a four digit which come in form of message in registered phone number and the customers have to verify that code with employee to get cylinder.In this function I had used while loop for repeatly take input of authentication code unless it  gets verified.
\subsection{Rating}
This function rates the delivary of cylinder according to the customer's choice. switch statements are used in this function for rating out of 5.
\subsection{offlinepay}
This functions takes payment from customer including extra charges according to the day of delivary customer choose.while loop is used in this function to take repeatly payment unless the payment is correct, the customer has three chance for payment.
\subsection{bookingbywtsp}
This functions helps the Customer to book online Cylinder by texting a single message REFIL on required number Also the customer can check the status of his/her status by texting STATUS.
